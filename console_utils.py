        Welcome to Antares Lumina!

        üí¨ What you can do:
        - Ask me anything Antares! If I don't know the answer, please feed it to me so I can learn for next time or the next person. 
        - Paste eng hub documentation links and Lumina will read, scrape, and store all the knowledge within the contents of the link.
            - You can also paste links to EngHubLinks.txt and ask me to process them all by saying "upload links from EngHubLinks.txt".
        - Type 'store/upload/save this in the knowledge base' to pull up a prompt to enter knowledge or context. Type 'END' on a new line when you're finished.
        - Type 'upload meeting transcript' to process all .txt files in the local MeetingTranscripts folder.
          
        To display my capabilities at any time, type 'help'.

        - Lumina searches across indexed documentation, release notes, and transcripts.
        - Context-aware memory and input from dozens of users daily helps it refine answers over time.
        - You'll be asked for feedback after each response to help improve answers.
        - Note: Lumina is only as good as your data. Please make sure your data is clean, clear, and useful, so that you and others can benefit. 
        

        In this dogfood release version, I will be like a new engineer on your team, learning from your feedback and interactions. So please be patient with me :)

        I'm constantly getting updates! Make sure to sync with latest changes from git
        
        For any issues or feedback, please reach out to aaboumahmoud & shenry
